# Hangman-Game

This is your classic hangman game. Developed using java, with a client server architecture. I used java socket programming and multithreading. 
The game supports single player and multiplayer. Each game has 5 lives, after 5 wrong entries you fail and can play again. 


To play: 
1. Run the the server file.
2. Run the client file.
3. Register your account.
4. Start Playing.

The game will end/disconnect from the server if the client/user clicks "-" as it was a requirement in the project.
